Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Paul Ruddock, a Data Analyst at Xander Talent, a leading client solutions consultancy based in London.

I help clients find the best solutions for their data-driven projects using Excel, SQL, Python, Scala, PowerBI and Tableau.

I enjoy gaming ðŸŽ®, watching anime and reading manga ðŸ“š, and cheering for Everton âš½.

My ongoing personal project is looking at u21 football players in various leagues that could potentially be a smart investment for a team like Everton.

My dream is to travel the world ðŸŒŽ and work remotely from anywhere.

If you want to connect with me, feel free to send me an email at **Paul.Ruddock@xandertalent.com**. Iâ€™m always open to new opportunities and collaborations. ðŸ˜Š
